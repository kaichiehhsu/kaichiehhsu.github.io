<!-- how to provide safety and convergence guarantees for learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning in zero-sum games, and -->
Recently, I have been focusing on
1. how to let learning-based autonomy safely operate in uncertain and unforeseen environments, especially safe exploration and bridging the sim2real gap.
2. how to develop safe and efficient autonomy stack, especially prediction-planning intergration and interpretable lens into the stack.
3. how to use game-theoretic reasoning for human intent inference and multiagent planning.
<!-- 3. how to infer and distinguish soft and hard constraints in human preferences by asking for ranking feedback on multiple candidate solutions. -->

Prior to joining Princeton University, I was an undergraduate researcher in electrical engineering, National Taiwan University.
I was a member of *Access LAB* (<a href="http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0)">Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>) focusing on intelligent reconstruction for compressed sensing ECG signals and a member of *Group of Electromagnetic Applications* (<a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/" style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0)">Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang</a>) focusing on direction-of-arrival estimation of signals.
