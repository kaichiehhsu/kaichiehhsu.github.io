Kai-Chieh Hsu is currently working toward a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, Princeton University with <p>Prof. Jaime Fern√°ndez Fisac </p>.
His research interests lie in machine learning, human-robot interaction, and multi-agent planning.
In particular, he applies different algorithms on safety-critical robotic systems with a focus on
1. how to guarantee our system can reach certain goal conditions while staying clear of unacceptable failure modes despite adversarial noise or agent, which is also known as reach-avoid control probleKms
2. how to infer reward functions as well as constraints of desired behaviors and
3. how to compete or coordinate with other agents in the system.

Prior to joining Princeton University, he was an undergraduate researcher in the electrical engineering, National Taiwan University.
He was a member of *Access LAB* (<a href="http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>) focusing on intelligent reconstruction for compressed sensing ECG signals and a member of *Group of Electromagnetic Applications* (<a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang</a>) focusing on direction-of-arrival estimation of signals.
