I am currently working toward a Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering, Princeton University.
I am so fortunate to work with <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac" style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0)"><span>Prof. Jaime Fern√°ndez Fisac</span></a>.
My research interests lie in machine learning, human-robot interaction, and multi-agent planning.
In particular, I apply different algorithms on safety-critical robotic systems with a focus on
1. how to guarantee systems can reach certain goal conditions while staying clear of unacceptable failure modes, which is known as reach-avoid control problems,
2. how to provide safety and convergence guarantees for learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning in zero-sum games, and
3. how to infer and distinguish soft and hard constraints in human preferences by asking for ranking feedback on multiple candidate solutions.

Prior to joining Princeton University, I was an undergraduate researcher in electrical engineering, National Taiwan University.
I was a member of *Access LAB* (<a href="http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0)">Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>) focusing on intelligent reconstruction for compressed sensing ECG signals and a member of *Group of Electromagnetic Applications* (<a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/" style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0)">Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang</a>) focusing on direction-of-arrival estimation of signals.
