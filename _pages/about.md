Kai-Chieh Hsu is currently working toward a Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering, Princeton University with <span>Prof. Jaime Fern√°ndez Fisac</span>.
His research interests lie in machine learning, human-robot interaction, and multi-agent planning.
In particular, he applies different algorithms on safety-critical robotic systems with a focus on
1. how to guarantee systems can reach certain goal conditions while staying clear of unacceptable failure modes, which is known as reach-avoid control problems,
2. how to provide safety and convergence guarantees for learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning in zero-sum games, and
3. how to infer and distinguish soft and hard constraints in human preferences by asking for ranking feedback on multiple candidate solutions.

Prior to joining Princeton University, he was an undergraduate researcher in electrical engineering, National Taiwan University.
He was a member of *Access LAB* (<a href="http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>) focusing on intelligent reconstruction for compressed sensing ECG signals and a member of *Group of Electromagnetic Applications* (<a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang</a>) focusing on direction-of-arrival estimation of signals.
