In this paper, to achieve low-complexity on-demand compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction, we propose a two-stage classification-aided reconstruction (TS-CAR) framework.
The compressed signals can be classified with a sparse coding based classifier, which provides the hardware sharing potential with reconstruction. Furthermore, to accelerate the reconstruction speed, a cross-domain sparse transform is applied from classification to reconstruction.
TS-CAR is implemented in electrocardiography based atrial fibrillation (AF) detection.
The average computational cost of TS-CAR is 2.25Ã— fewer compared to traditional frameworks when AF percentage is among 10% to 50%. 
Finally, we implement TS-CAR in TSMC 40 nm technology.
The post-layout results show that the proposed intelligent CS reconstruction engine can provide a competitive area- and energy-efficiency compared to state-of-the-art CS and machine learning engines.
