In this work, we want to accelerate the design exploration by inferring human preference.
We aim to invert the specification generation process by asking the most informative queries to human and receiving their feedback, which we called inverse specification (InvSpec).
With this feedback, we can construct a likelihood model and use gradient-based methods or Bayesian inference methods to learn human preference representation.
